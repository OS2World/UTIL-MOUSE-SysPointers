What it does ?
---------------

SysPointers allows you to use custom pointers with OS/2.
You can easily replace the arrow,clock,and sizing pointers
with custom ones created with Iconedit (shipped with OS/2).
Some example pointers are supplied (in the file POINTERS.ZIP).

--------------

Installation :

Just copy SysPointers into any subdirectory and the migrate it.


To install a custom pointer :

Choose the pointer you want to change using the listbox. Click the button
CHOOSE POINTER. Choose the file containing the custom pointer...
the pointer is changed...

To uninstall a custom pointer:

Choose the pointer you want to uninstall using the listbox.
Click the button UNINSTALL. (if the pointer is not installed the button
UNINSTALL is grayed). To revert to the original system pointer you must
perform a shutdown.

To exit from syspointers:

Click the button OK. (that was easy...)
